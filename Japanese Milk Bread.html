<h4> Steps</h4> <br>
<h5> <strong>To make the Tangzhong</strong></h5>
<ol> 
    <li> <p> 
        Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
    </p> </li>
    <li> <p>
        Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines
        on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
    </p> </li>
    <li> <p> 
        Transfer the Tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to lukewarm.
    </p></li>
</ol>
<h6><strong> To make the dough </strong></h6>
<ol> 
    <li> <p> 
        Weigh your flour, or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
        Combine the Tangzhongwith the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead- by mixer or bread 
        machine- until a smooth, elastic dough forms; this could take almost 15 minutes in a stand mixer. 
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 60 to 90 minutes,
        until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Gently deflate the dough and divide it into four equal pieces; If you have a scale each piece will weigh between 
        170g and 175g.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Flatten each piece of dough into a 5" x 8" rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter.
        Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again (this time 3" x 6") and, starting with a short end, roll them each
        into a 4" log.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Place the logs in a row of four--seam side down and side by side- in a lightly greased 9"x5" loaf pan.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> 
        Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350F.
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> <Strong> To bake the bread: </Strong>
    Brush the loaf with milk and bake it for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown on top and a digital thermometer
inserted into the center reads at least 190F.
 </p> </li>
 <li> <p> 
     Remove the loaf from the oven and cool it in the pan until you can transfer it safely to a rack to cool completely.
 </p></li>
 <li> <p> 
     Store leftover bread, well wrapped, at cool room temperature for 5 to 7 days; freeze for longer storage. 
 </p></li>
